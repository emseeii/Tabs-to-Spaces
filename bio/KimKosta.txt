Kim Kosta is a thousand-year-old career hermit who has descended from her cave in the mountains solely to master the art of sympathetic magic. She plans to use her new skill to defeat her arch nemesis, the fearsome Omegalodon, once and for all. The two battle once every decade, but are so evenly matched that neither has yet triumphed over the other.
