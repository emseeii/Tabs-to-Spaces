Established in 1990, Collin White was born to rock. Kinda. Hailing from musical roots (his dad is a rockstar, even still at 62 years old), Collin taught himself to play guitar at the age of 13. With a primarily acoustic style, most of his venues cames at highschool bonfires, singing coombaya songs and entertaining friends. With a love for all music, he covered popular songs of the time, which gained popularity amongst his peeps. Upon starting college and moving to Tuscaloosa, the time for music has been cut short, but has been reborn upon taking CS491. CS491 has given him one last hope at becoming a rockstar. In other words, he will never be a rockstar.
