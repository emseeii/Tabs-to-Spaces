It began by forging his own steel from the iron of the mightiest mountain then winding it into strings of varying size. After pulling them taught the first guitar solo was born. Pythagoras, after taken inspiration by this solo, pondered the ratios between these strings and the first musical scale was born. Some say this solo was the birth of music.
