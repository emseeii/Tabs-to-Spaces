When the War of the Ring broke out in Middle Earth, Mason Saucier was born from the remains of elves that were slain at the Siege of Lorien.  As an undead elf, Mason posseses the ablility to play hardcore rock with a lute.  Many people come to his concerts and as a result he has gained an undead cult following.  Looking to hone his skills, he has combined forces with others that also have musical ability. He needs them because he does not have the heart for music.
