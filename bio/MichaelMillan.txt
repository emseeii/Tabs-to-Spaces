In Ancient Greece, there were two factions that controlled the land. The clever Athenians, which excelled in law and scholarly matters, and the Spartans, which were known all across the land for their ruthlessness and ability in combat. In Spartan culture, babies that are deemed weak at birth were tossed over a cliff in order to try and keep the Spartan race strong. One baby was not even considered for this. He was strong. He was destined to be kind. Time passed, and he proved himself time and time again that he was worthy, whether it was through battle, dance battles, or beatboxing. He seized Kingship and became the monarch of Sparta. He would lead his Spartans to many victories, whether they were in war or rap battling against the Athenians.
