Houston Farris Searcy's family has been flowing with fame for time unfathomable. Descended from the legendary King Leonidas, Houston literally lunged into the life of a living legend. Learning to light up the lute from the little age of eleven, the lad's leap into the light of stardom came early on. The ever-heightening level of his unequaled early era expectedly came equipped with an extraordinary ego. After a while, the accomplished young adult added an array of astounding musical aptitudes to his already amazing arsenal of attractive artforms. At the present he is proud to proclaim his person as the profound pupil of the princely arts, the sumptuous student of the splendid song, and the delightful disciple of the dazzling ditty.
