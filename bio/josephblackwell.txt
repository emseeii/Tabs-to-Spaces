Joseph learned to play the wall drums at a very early age, and kept learning several other instruments (including the leg drums, armpit bagpipes, and rubber band guitar) until he got bored and did something else. He used to be fluent in 37 languages, but forgot all of them. He once made a sand castle that survived a siege be the great Sand Crab Alliance for three and a half tides. He plays the guitar, but only plays the most indie song imaginable. His reflexes are so good he can dodge nerf darts fired from point blank range. His musical talents include autotune impersonations, playing everything by ear, and never practicing.
