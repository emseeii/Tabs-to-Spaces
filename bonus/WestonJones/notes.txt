My song implemented the acoustic guitar and a high-pitched and a low-pitched version of the adrian bass. The adrian bass in a high ocvtave has a natural percussion characteristic to it, and is noticible throughout the song. I used the high-octave plucks on different beats during the song which makes your ear hear the beat of the acoustic guitar differently.
