Houston Searcy
I had originally planned to make my song light and whimsical, using a tin whistle pitched high.
As I started experimenting with sounds, though, I stumbled across a nice E chord progression that I liked the sound of, and I just ran with that.
The result is a somewhat dark toned piece using a cello, recorder, piano, and violin.
