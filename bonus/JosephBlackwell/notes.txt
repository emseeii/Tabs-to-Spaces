Lyrics:

VERSE 1:
Some days I wonder just what I will be
Some days I sample the bitt'rest of drinks
Some days I cannot stand on my own
Some days the world just seems like too much
Some days I'm not sure just who I can trust
Some days I wonder if you're here


CHORUS:
Yet I know one of these days
All this darkness will be dispelled
And the morning will come
Bursting forth like the sun
But for now all I need
Is to know you are here


VERSE 2:
Some days I fight just a little too hard
Some days the rain won't stop falling on me
Some days I feel like more flicker than flame
Some days my burdens are dragging me down
Some days my friends are far fewer than foes
Some days these walls won't stop hemming me in
Some days this rainstorm feels more like a drought
Some days my feet just won't let me move on
Some days my life keeps on passing me by
Some days I wonder if you're here


CHORUS


BRIDGE:
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
